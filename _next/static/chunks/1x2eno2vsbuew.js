business, managing data warehouses, platforms, pipelines, and ML models the way a PM manages a product.",body:`A **Data Product Manager (DPM)** is a specialized role at the intersection of
**data, technology, and business**. Where a traditional PM manages the
lifecycle of a physical or software product, a DPM manages *data products*:
data warehouses, data platforms, analytics tools, data pipelines, or ML
models.

## Overlap with traditional PM
Both roles own product vision, roadmap, stakeholder expectations, and the
overall product lifecycle.

## Where it diverges
- Traditional PMs lean more on UX/UI and go-to-market/marketing execution.
- DPMs lean more technical and data-specific — though this varies: a DPM
  acting as a data broker needs strong market/launch skills, and a DPM
  building analytics products may need real UX/UI chops.

## Four key shifts nobody talks about
| | General PM | Data PM |
|---|---|---|
| **Risk profile** | Ship (potentially) buggy code, push a fix | Ship bad data, lose trust — often for good |
| **Success metrics** | Usage, engagement, retention | Data quality, decision velocity, trust signals |
| **Customer journey** | "Wow, this is great!" | "I don't trust this yet… but maybe…" |
| **Team dynamic** | "When can we ship?" | "How do we validate?" |

The throughline: a Data PM's core job is **earning and protecting trust** in
the data, not just shipping features.

## DPM vs. the roles it gets confused with
| | Data Product Manager | The other role |
|---|---|---|
| **vs. Data Scientist / Analyst** | The strategic *what* and *why*: defines the vision for the data, creates reliable, well-structured data assets, makes analysis possible in the first place | The analytical *how*: the primary consumer of data products, analyzes data to extract insights, focuses on the specifics of a given analysis |
| **vs. Data Engineer** | Defines the requirements: partners with engineering, decides what infrastructure needs to exist, prioritizes the engineering backlog | Builds the infrastructure: the primary builder of data systems, constructs pipelines and storage, implements the technical requirements |
| **vs. Data Manager** | Strategic value creation: leverages data for new value, solves business problems with data products, drives tangible outcomes | Technical and operational oversight: administers systems, manages storage and maintenance, ensures operational compliance |

A useful test: the analyst asks *what does the data say?*, the engineer asks
*how do we move and store it?*, the data manager asks *is it maintained and
compliant?*, and the Data PM asks *which data product should exist, for
whom, and how will we know it's trusted?*`,source:"PRD - Data Product Management.pdf; role comparison from the user's notes."},{slug:"four-key-shifts",title:"The Four Key Shifts (Data PM vs. General PM)",category:"framework",tags:["role","mindset"],summary:"Risk profile, success metrics, customer journey, and team dynamic all invert when you move from general PM to data PM.",body:`Four dimensions where Data Product Management inverts the general-PM

   a dashboard or a decision can burn trust permanently.
2. **Success metrics** — usage/engagement/retention give way to data
   quality, decision velocity, and trust signals (do people actually act on
   the number?).
3. **Customer journey** — delight is not the opening emotion. Skepticism
   is. The arc is "I don't trust this yet… but maybe."
4. **Team dynamic** — the team's default question shifts from "when can we
   ship?" to "how do we validate?"

- **Silver** — filtered, cleaned, augmented. Deduplicated, typed, joined
  with reference data — usable but not yet aggregated for a specific
  business question.
- **Gold** — business-level aggregates. The layer that actually feeds
  streaming analytics, AI, and reporting; this is typically where a data
  product's **output ports** read from.

   actual end users.
4. **Purpose-driven** — true data product initiatives tied to specific
   business purposes, measured by clear North Star / functional / granular
   metrics.

Most organizations are in Reactive, occasionally Strategy-driven. The whole

These three sit in a **Metric Dependency Tree (MDT)**: granular metrics
roll up into functional metrics, which roll up into the North Star. This is

Key questions to answer in week 1: What are the user's pain points? What
value can the data bring to close the gaps? Which persona benefits most?

1. **Input ports** — where data enters, from source systems.
2. **Transformation steps** — the logic that turns raw input into the
   model's measures/dimensions.
3. **Output ports** — where consumers read the result (often a Gold-layer
   table; see [[medallion-architecture]]).
4. **SLOs** — quality and governance conditions on the pipeline.

Without a self-service layer, these four "simple" pieces become hundreds of
sub-pieces: credential management, workflow/service configuration from
scratch, tool integration, and transformations only a few senior engineers
understand. A good self-serve platform lets an analytics engineer just
declare input/output locations and transform steps in a spec file (e.g.
YAML) and get ready-to-use workflows, monitors, and connectors for free.`,source:"6-Week Data Products Product Playbook.pdf"},{slug:"self-service-infrastructure",title:"Self-Service Infrastructure (SSI)",category:"framework",tags:["platform","data-mesh"],summary:"Ready-to-use resources (policy, monitor, workflow, contract, service, secret, compute) that let engineers declare intent instead of building plumbing from scratch.",body:`**Self-service** means business/data teams get ready-to-use resources
instead of building plumbing themselves. An analytics engineer declares
input/output locations and transform steps; the self-serve infrastructure

Reported impact of a good self-serve layer (industry-reported ranges, not
guarantees): ~90% reduction in time to implement new use cases, ~50%
reduction in governance/data-quality risk, ~30% reduction in total cost of

**localized** — each system encoded its own definition of "customer,"
"policy," or "contract," often in application logic or people's heads.

ambiguity. Is "revenue" GAAP-recognized or bookings? Is "customer" the CRM
record or the billing record? Every agent without a shared semantic
structure just picks whichever definition it encounters first — and at
scale, that guess compounds into a liability, not a rounding error.

**Industry signal (Q2 2026):** 80% of surveyed leaders rank a semantic
layer with standardized definitions as the *most* important enabler of AI

product is "built once, and agents consume forever," replacing agents that
rebuild context from scratch on every query.`,source:"State of Data Products, Q2 2026 (Modern Data 101)."},{slug:"agent-observability-gap",title:"Agent Observability ≠ Agent Correctness",category:"industry-context",tags:["ai-agents","observability","2026"],summary:"Most teams running AI agents have monitoring (did it run?) but not evaluation (was it right?) — and standard software testing assumptions don't hold for agents.",body:`Monitoring tells you an agent ran. It does not tell you whether it
**reasoned well**. As of Q2 2026, industry surveys report 89% of teams
running AI agents have observability tooling, but only 52% have evaluation
frameworks.

Why normal software testing breaks down for agents: it assumes
determinism (same input → same output). Agents don't hold that property —
the same task can complete through multiple valid tool-call paths, and an
agent can produce a plausible-looking output through a completely broken
reasoning path that no dashboard flags.

Three observability primitives most production teams are missing: trace
IDs that follow an agent thread end-to-end, per-tool-call token budgets,
and semantic assertion layers that validate outputs *before* they reach a
user (not just log the request/response pair).

**Takeaway for a DPM:** the fix is upstream — in the semantic
infrastructure, data contracts, and governance rules that define "correct"
before the agent runs — not just in a dashboard that reports what already
happened.`,source:"State of Data Products, Q2 2026 (Modern Data 101)."},{slug:"lean-ai-cost-economics",title:"Lean AI: Matching Model Size to Task Difficulty",category:"industry-context",tags:["cost","llm-economics","2026"],summary:"Small language models can be ~100x cheaper than large ones per conversation; mature teams route by difficulty rather than defaulting to the biggest model.",body:`Per-token pricing looks fine at demo scale and gets expensive fast at real

conversations through a large frontier model at roughly **$15,000–$75,000**,
versus **$150–$800** through a small model — a swing of roughly 100x.

The framing that's replacing the "small vs. large" debate: **narrow AI**
(small, task-specific, embedded in a disciplined data platform) for the
high-volume, well-defined slice of work, reserving **big AI** (general
frontier models) for the harder, open-ended fraction that actually needs
that range. The Toyota Production System parallel being used in the
industry: the goal isn't a smaller model, it's producing more value with
fewer resources without sacrificing quality — the same question Taiichi
Ohno asked of manufacturing waste seventy years earlier.

**Takeaway for a DPM:** cost-per-outcome, not raw capability, is

Legacy/manual OEE computation breaks at multi-factory scale; a medallion pipeline fixes latency and drill-down.",body:`**Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)** is the standard metric for
manufacturing equipment productivity:

\`\`\`
OEE = Machine Availability \xd7 Process Efficiency \xd7 Product Quality
\`\`\`

An OEE of 85%+ is considered world-leading; most manufacturers land at
40–60%; below 40% is low. Different teams use it differently — shop floor
teams use it to find lagging processes, executives use aggregates to judge
overall performance and justify capital investment (ROIC).

**The problem:** OEE computation was traditionally manual. At multi-factory
scale, that breaks two things at once — freshness (information needs to
flow continuously with minimal latency) and consistency (every stakeholder
needs to work off the *same* numbers, with the ability to drill into an OEE
drift).

**The pattern:** incrementally ingest sensor/IoT data → clean and extract
the needed fields → integrate workforce data from ERP systems → merge and
aggregate in real time over a temporal window → surface KPIs. This maps
directly onto [[medallion-architecture]]: Bronze (raw sensor ingestion),
Silver (cleaned, joined with ERP data), Gold (the aggregated OEE/KPI layer
that feeds dashboards).

**RCA angle:** when a reported OEE number looks wrong, the first question
is *which factor* moved — availability, efficiency, or quality — and
whether the drift is a real operational issue or a broken upstream
transform.`,source:"The Big Book of Data Science Use Cases, 2nd Edition (Databricks)."},{slug:"data-quality-dimensions",title:"Data Quality Dimensions (and how to write an SLO)",category:"framework",tags:["data-quality","slo","week-3"],summary:"Six dimensions — completeness, uniqueness, timeliness, consistency, validity, accuracy — each becomes an SLO once you name the measurement, threshold, and check time.",body:`A data product's SLOs are promises about the data, not about the pipeline.
The classic six dimensions give you the vocabulary:

| Dimension | Question | Example SLO at Meridian |
|---|---|---|
| **Completeness** | Are required values present? | 100% of closed deals have a \`closed_date\` |
| **Uniqueness** | Is each real-world event recorded once? | No two transactions share (deal, amount, date) |
| **Timeliness** (freshness) | Is the data recent enough? | Latest successful \`deals\` load < 24h old at 09:00 |
| **Consistency** | Do two representations agree? | \`deals.stage\` equals the latest \`deal_stage_history\` row |
| **Validity** | Do values conform to rules? | \`stage\` ∈ the six allowed values; \`amount\` > 0 |
| **Accuracy** | Does the value match reality? | Bookings reconcile to signed contracts (sampled) |

## Writing an SLO that can actually be checked
An SLO has three parts: the **measurement** (a query), the **threshold**, and
**when** it is evaluated. "The pipeline runs at 02:00" is a schedule. "The
latest successful run is never more than 24 hours old at 09:00, measured
from \`pipeline_runs\`" is an SLO.

## Why "success" is not enough
A run can succeed and still ingest a partial file (row count drops 70%),
re-ingest yesterday's file (duplicates), or land on time with stale
upstream data. Every one of those is invisible to a status column and
visible to a data check. That's the difference between *pipeline
observability* (did it run?) and *data quality* (is it right?).`,source:"Synthesized for DPM Lab from common data-quality practice; ties to the Playbook's Activation week."},{slug:"funnel-conversion-analysis",title:"Funnel Analysis: Overall vs. Stage-to-Stage, Cohorts, Velocity",category:"framework",tags:["metrics","funnel","rca","week-2","week-5"],summary:"Three different funnel questions need three different queries: overall conversion (by cohort), stage-to-stage conversion (from the history log), and time in stage (velocity).",body:`"Conversion rate" hides three questions. A Data PM keeps them apart.

## 1. Overall conversion — *did it close?*
\`won \xf7 (won + lost)\` on **resolved** deals. Report it by **created-month
cohort**, because recent cohorts haven't had time to close and will always
look worse at the right edge of the chart. Excluding open deals is the
first thing to do before believing any drop.

## 2. Stage-to-stage conversion — *where do they drop?*
Needs the **append-only history**, not the current stage. For each stage,
count distinct deals that *ever entered* it; the ratio between consecutive
stages is the drop-off. A deal that skipped a stage simply never appears in
it.

## 3. Velocity — *where do they stall?*
Days between consecutive history rows for the same deal, i.e.
\`LEAD(entered_at) OVER (PARTITION BY deal_id ORDER BY entered_at)\`. A
stage whose duration doubles is a stronger RCA signal than a rate that
wobbles.

## Using the three together (the RCA walk)
1. Confirm the drop is real on resolved, mature cohorts.
2. Slice overall conversion by one dimension at a time (region, source,
   rep, tier). A cause that touches everything (a price increase) can't
   explain a change in one cell.
3. In the affected cell, look at stage-to-stage and velocity to see
   *where* in the funnel the loss happens. Late-funnel losses with longer
   negotiation usually mean lead quality; early losses mean targeting.`,source:"Synthesized for DPM Lab; builds on the Playbook's Metric Dependency Tree."},{slug:"sql-toolkit-for-data-pms",title:"The SQL a Data PM Actually Uses",category:"definition",tags:["sql","skills"],summary:"CTEs for readable steps, window functions for per-row context, date bucketing for trends, and the four bugs that silently corrupt metrics.",body:"You are not writing production pipelines.

Readable beats clever.\n- **Window functions** — `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY deal_id ORDER BY\n  entered_at DESC)` for \"latest per entity\"; `LAG`/`LEAD` for change\n  between rows; `SUM(...) OVER (ORDER BY month)` for running totals;\n  `AVG(...) OVER (... ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)` for moving\n  averages.\n- **Date bucketing** — `substr(date, 1, 7)` for month, `strftime('%Y-%W',\n  ts)` for ISO-ish week, `julianday(b) - julianday(a)` for day differences\n  (SQLite).\n- **Conditional aggregation** — `SUM(CASE WHEN ... THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` (or\n  `SUM(condition)` in SQLite) to compute several rates in one pass.\n- **HAVING** — filter *after* aggregation; the idiom for duplicates:\n  `GROUP BY key HAVING COUNT(*) > 1`.\n\n## The four silent metric bugs\n1. **Join fan-out** — joining a 1:N table before an aggregate multiplies\n   the measure. Aggregate the N side first.\n2. **LEFT JOIN + WHERE on the right table** — turns it into an inner join\n   and hides exactly the missing rows you were looking for. Put the\n   condition in `ON`.\n3. **COUNT(*) vs COUNT(DISTINCT x)** — views vs viewers, rows vs people.\n4. **Integer division** — `7 / 10 = 0` in many engines.
